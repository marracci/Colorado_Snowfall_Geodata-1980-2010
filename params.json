We have enhanced the PRISM gridded dataset using GIS technology by incorporating point precipitation values from the Colorado Avalanche Information Center's (CAIC) historical database. The data covers the water-year months of November through April, and was collected by ski area operators in Colorado and by the CAIC for highway avalanche forecasting operations. The result is a set of vector shapefiles detailing long-term (1981-2010), cold-season precipitation for the Colorado mountains. The dataset includes mean precipitation values for winter months; variability - % of mean, standard deviation, and identifies outlier events. We used these data to produce a mapset that will help benefit daily weather and avalanche forecasting operations as well as increase our capability to characterize the snow and avalanche climate areas of Colorado.<br><br>\r\n<b>Language of Article:</b> English<br>\r\n\r\n<b>Keywords:</b> forecasting, precipitation, mapping, snow climate, gis.<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png\" /></a><br /><span xmlns:dct=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" property=\"dct:title\">Climate-Scale Maps of Cold-Season Precipitation in the Mountainous Areas of Colorado for Operational Forecasting Applications</span> by <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"http://arc.lib.montana.edu/snow-science/item/2095\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" rel=\"cc:attributionURL\">B.J.
